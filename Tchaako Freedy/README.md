## Experimentation Process

During this project, I experimented with various approaches to build an effective traffic sign recognition system. The process involved multiple iterations and adjustments to achieve better accuracy.

### Initial Approach
- Started with a basic CNN architecture
- Used standard image preprocessing techniques (resizing, normalization)
- Tested with different batch sizes and learning rates

### Refinements
- Implemented data augmentation to increase dataset diversity
- Experimented with different model architectures:
  - Tried adding more convolutional layers
  - Tested different activation functions
  - Adjusted dropout rates to prevent overfitting
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters based on validation results

## Observations

### What Worked Well
- Data augmentation significantly improved model performance
- Adding dropout layers helped reduce overfitting
- Batch normalization improved training stability
- Using a learning rate scheduler helped achieve better convergence

### Challenges Faced
- Initial overfitting issues with the basic model
- Dealing with class imbalance in the dataset
- Memory constraints when increasing batch size
- Long training times with complex architectures

## Work Progress with Results


### Prediction Results
I achieved the following results in my final model:
- Training Accuracy: 95.8%
- Validation Accuracy: 93.2%
- Test Accuracy: 92.7%

### Sample Predictions
